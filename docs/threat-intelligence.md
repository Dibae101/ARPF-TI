- Threat actor information when available
- Contextual information about the threat
- Recommended response actions

### Dashboard Integration

Threat intelligence is visualized in dashboards:

- Threat source distribution
- Indicator type breakdown
- Geographic threat map
- Emerging threat trends

## Exporting Threat Intelligence

### Manual Export

1. Navigate to **Threat Intelligence > Entries**
2. Apply filters as needed
3. Click **Export**
4. Select format (CSV, JSON, STIX)
5. Download the file

## Maintenance and Optimization

### Regular Maintenance Tasks

- **Purge Expired Indicators**: Remove outdated threat data
- **Recalculate Confidence Scores**: Update scores based on new information
- **Validate Sources**: Ensure all sources are functioning properly
- **Update Integration Credentials**: Refresh API keys and passwords

### Performance Optimization

   - Caching parameters
   - Maximum entries per source
   - Batch processing size

## Troubleshooting

### Source Connection Issues

If a source fails to connect:

1. Verify network connectivity
2. Check API credentials
3. Confirm the source URL is correct
4. Review source-specific logs at **System > Logs > Threat Intelligence**

### Data Quality Issues

If receiving low-quality or irrelevant data:

1. Increase the minimum confidence threshold
2. Adjust tag filters to exclude irrelevant categories
3. Configure type filters to focus on specific indicator types
4. Consider disabling problematic sources

### Performance Problems

If experiencing slowdowns:

1. Reduce pull frequency for less critical sources
2. Increase the minimum confidence threshold
3. Implement more aggressive expiration policies
4. Adjust database performance settings

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Quality Sources**: Begin with well-established feeds like AlienVault OTX or MISP
2. **Filter Aggressively**: Use high confidence thresholds initially and lower as needed
3. **Regular Maintenance**: Purge old indicators regularly
4. **Layered Defense**: Use threat intelligence as one part of a comprehensive security strategy
5. **Monitor False Positives**: Track and adjust based on false positive rates
6. **Augment with Context**: Add local context to improve relevance
